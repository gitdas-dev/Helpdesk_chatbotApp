# BankAssist Chatbot

A modern banking assistant chatbot built with React and Node.js.

## AI-Assisted Development
During the development of this project, I utilized Cursor AI code editor's chat composer to enhance productivity and code quality. Here are some notable examples:

### 1. Chat Response Generation Logic

Cursor AI chat composer helped generate the response logic for different banking queries. For example:

```javascript
constconst generateBankResponse = (message) => {
  const input = message.toLowerCase();

  // Copilot suggested these comprehensive conditions
  if (input.includes("account type") || input.includes("types of account")) {
    return "We offer these account types: \n1. Savings Account (3.5% interest) \n2. Checking Account \n3. Student Account (no fees) \n4. Business Account \nWhich one interests you?";
  }

  if (input.includes("minimum") || input.includes("initial deposit")) {
    return "Minimum initial deposits: \n- Savings: $100 \n- Checking: $50 \n- Student: $0 \n- Business: $500";
  }
};
```

 
### 2. Dynamic Chat Options

Cursor AI chat composer helped implement the dynamic chat options feature by suggesting the following pattern:

```javascript
const getOptionsForResponse = (response) => {
if (response.includes("Would you like to know about our account types?")) {
return ["Yes, tell me about account types", "No, I have other questions"];
}
if (response.includes("Which one interests you?")) {
return ["Savings Account", "Checking Account", "Student Account", "Business Account"];
}
};
```


### Benefits of AI Assistance

1. **Faster Development**: Cursor AI code editor's chat composer significantly reduced the time spent writing boilerplate code and common patterns.
2. **Better Code Quality**: Suggested code followed best practices and included proper error handling.
3. **Learning Opportunity**: Cursor AI's suggestions introduced new patterns and approaches I hadn't considered.
4. **Consistent Styling**: Helped maintain consistent code style across the project.

### Challenges and Solutions

One challenge was ensuring the chatbot responses were contextually appropriate. Cursor AI chat composer helped by suggesting a comprehensive set of response patterns based on user input keywords. This improved the chatbot's ability to handle various banking queries effectively.
